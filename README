This software is based on init-gmouse (a4_tool) from Marisa-Chan https://github.com/Marisa-Chan/init-gmouse

The Program is designed only for G-series. Support for other mice like X7-series is incomplete, but some functions may work.
If you have an "oscar" mouse please use wireshark and virtualbox with windows to capture and compare bytes that are sent by original program.

You need libgmouse library.
